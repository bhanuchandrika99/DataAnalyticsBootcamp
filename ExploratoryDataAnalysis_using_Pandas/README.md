Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas: 
In this analysis, I began by loading the population dataset into a pandas DataFrame and exploring its structure with methods such as .info() and .describe() to get an overview of data types, ranges, and the presence of missing values. This initial inspection revealed key characteristics, such as the range of population sizes and summary statistics for each numeric column. Additionally, identified the presence of null values, which were handled appropriately to ensure accurate analysis.

Next, proceeded with data visualization to understand the distribution of population values across different regions. Using seaborn and matplotlib, created visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots. These visualizations highlighted patterns in population distribution, with some regions exhibiting notably higher populations than others. Also, examined the relationship between population data and other demographic variables, identifying potential correlations and trends that could be useful for further analysis.

Lastly, conducted sorting and grouping operations to pinpoint countries or regions with the highest and lowest populations, as well as those experiencing significant growth over recent years. This involved grouping data by specific columns and analyzing mean and median values across categories, enabling deeper insights into regional population characteristics. Through these EDA steps, gained valuable insights into global population patterns and identified areas that may warrant more detailed investigation, such as the factors driving population growth in particular regions. ​​

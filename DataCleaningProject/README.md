In this Data Cleaning Project using MYSQL Workbench, We focused on identifying and handling missing or NULL values, correcting inconsistent or incorrectly formatted data, and ensuring standardization across data entries. This includes tasks like filling or removing nulls, normalizing text formats, and fixing data types. The goal is to prepare the data for accurate analysis and reporting.

1. Took raw dataset: https://github.com/bhanuchandrika99/DataAnalyticsBootcamp/blob/main/DataCleaningProject/layoffs.csv
2. Imported raw dataset to MYSQL Workbench and created a new dataset layoffs_staging to make changes 
3. Removed duplicates from each column
4. Standardize the Data (FINDING ISSUES IN YOUR DATA AND FIXING IT)
5. Checked for NULL values and Blank values. Also, filled few missing values that we have information on , by checking the similar company information.
6. Removed blank values that we no longer needed.
7. Deleted columns and rows that are redundant and few which are no longer needed.

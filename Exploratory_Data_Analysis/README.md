In this Exploratory Data Analysis project , Using the layoffs_cleaned.csv from previous Data Cleaning Project, We focused on summarizing cleaned data through descriptive statistics, visualizing distributions of individual variables, and examining relationships between variables. We can also extend using tools like histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices. 

This analysis helped uncover patterns, trends, and potential anomalies to better understand the dataset before applying advanced modeling techniques.

Few analysis covered are as follows:
1. - Which company did most layoffs --
2. -- Maximum and Minimun layoffs on a day --
3. -- Industry that was most effected by layoffs --
4. -- Which country has most layoffs--
5. -- Which year has most layoffs --
6. -- which stage has most layoffs --
7. -- Which company has most layoff percentage considering all industries --
8. -- Which MONTH has most layoffs --
9. -- calculating rolling total based on the month over SUM(total_laid_off) --
10. -- Highest ranked companies that laidoff employees in the years 2020 to 2023 --

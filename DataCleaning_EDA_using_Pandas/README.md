Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas: 
In this project, we utilized pandas for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a population dataset, supported by matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations. The data included demographic information such as age distribution, gender, and population counts by region. The cleaning process involved handling missing values, correcting data types, and standardizing column names for consistency. We addressed outliers using statistical methods like interquartile range (IQR) and removed duplicates to ensure data integrity. This preliminary cleaning prepared the dataset for meaningful exploration and visualization.

For EDA, we conducted descriptive analyses to understand overall population characteristics and identify trends. Visualizations, including histograms, box plots, and bar charts, provided insights into the population distribution across age groups, gender, and regional classifications. We analyzed regional population variations, including the urban-rural split, and used correlation analysis to examine potential relationships among age, population size, and gender distribution. The analysis revealed key demographic patterns, such as dominant age groups and regions with high population density, offering valuable insights into population dynamics and areas for further research.

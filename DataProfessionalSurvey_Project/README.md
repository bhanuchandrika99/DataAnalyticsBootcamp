Data Professional Survey Project using Power BI:

In this project, a dashboard was created using Power BI to visualize insights from a Data Professional Survey dataset. The dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power Query, where columns were split using delimiters, and unnecessary and blank columns were removed. Additionally, the salary data, initially presented in a range format, was converted to calculate an average salary for each entry.

After data transformation, various visualizations were developed to represent key insights, including a breakdown of survey participants by country, average salary by job title, and the difficulty level of entering the data field. Other visualizations displayed the favorite programming languages among professionals and their satisfaction levels with work-life balance and salary. These visualizations were compiled into an interactive and comprehensive dashboard, providing an overview of the demographics, preferences, and experiences of data professionals.

This dashboard offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing users to interact with different visual elements for deeper analysis. For example, the tree map displays the distribution of survey takers by country, highlighting the most represented regions, while the bar chart reveals the average salaries across various job titles like data scientists, engineers, and analysts. Additionally, gauge charts show the average satisfaction levels regarding work-life balance and salary, providing a quick glance at the overall sentiment of the respondents. The donut chart illustrates how survey participants perceive the difficulty of entering the data industry, categorizing responses from "Very Easy" to "Very Difficult." This comprehensive approach ensures that the dashboard effectively communicates the trends and insights extracted from the survey data, making it a valuable tool for understanding the data professional landscape.

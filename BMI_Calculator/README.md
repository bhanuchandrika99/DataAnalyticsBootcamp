BMI calculator:
A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator using Python is a simple beginner project that allows users to determine their BMI based on their height and weight. The program takes user input for height (in inches) and weight (in pounds) and calculates the BMI using the formula: 
  BMI = (weight in pounds x 703) / (height in inches x height in inches)
The output also categorizes the BMI value into different health ranges, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese, based on standard BMI ranges set by the World Health Organization (WHO).
  Under 18.5	Underweight
  18.5 - 24.9	Normal Weight
  25 - 29.9	Overweight
  30 - 34.9	Obese
  35 - 39.9	Severely Obese
  40 and over	Morbidly Obese

The project demonstrates fundamental Python skills, such as using variables, conditional statements, and mathematical operations. It also provides an opportunity to practice user input handling, data validation, and the conversion between different units (e.g., feet to meters or pounds to kilograms). For further improvement, the program can be extended to include a graphical user interface (GUI) or a web-based interface using libraries like Tkinter or Flask, making it more interactive and user-friendly.

Scraping Data from a Real Website using BeautifulSoup and Pandas:
This project demonstrates how to scrape and structure data from a Wikipedia page using Pythonâ€™s Beautiful Soup and Pandas libraries. 

The code begins by retrieving the HTML content from the page listing the largest companies in the United States by revenue. It identifies and extracts the first table's column headers, converting them into a readable list format. The script then populates a Pandas DataFrame with each row from the table, transforming the HTML into a structured, tabular format suitable for analysis.After constructing the DataFrame, the code exports the data to a CSV file, saving it locally for further exploration and analysis. This step highlights how web scraping can automate data collection processes, turning unstructured online information into useful, structured data. 

Additionally, the project showcases file handling and exporting capabilities, emphasizing the value of these skills for anyone looking to work in data analytics or automation. This project is an excellent example of how Python libraries can be combined to gather, manipulate, and store data efficiently from online sources.

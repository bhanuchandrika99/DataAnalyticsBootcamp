An automatic file sorter using Python is a project designed to organize files in a specified directory based on their file types. The script scans through a target folder, identifies file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .pdf, .txt), and moves files into corresponding subfolders like “Images,” “Documents,” “Videos,” or “Archives.” 
The program uses Python libraries such as os and shutil for file and directory manipulation, ensuring that the files are organized efficiently without any manual intervention. This type of automation helps keep directories tidy, improving file management and productivity.

This project demonstrates key programming skills such as file handling, directory traversal, and condition checking in Python. It also offers an introduction to automation tasks, encouraging the user to explore additional functionalities like sorting files based on creation or modification dates or adding custom rules for sorting. By integrating libraries such as watchdog, the file sorter can be extended to monitor directories in real time, automatically sorting new files as they are added, making it a more dynamic and efficient tool for managing files on a system.

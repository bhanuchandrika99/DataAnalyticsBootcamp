Full_Excel_Project: Excel is one of the most used skills in the data world. In this project, we cleaned a raw data set and summarised the data into readable format by creating dashboard using pivot tables and pivot charts.

 Excel Project;
1.	Removed duplicates
2.	Changed Marital status to Married/Single status and Gender to Male/Female status to more readable format using find&replace (Ctrl+H)
3.	Removing decimals in currency
4.	Setting up age brackets: 
      Less Than 31: Adolescent
      Greater Than or Equal to 31: Middle Age
      Greater Than 54 : Old
5.	Created pivot tables to organize, rearrange and manipulate data dynamically to gain insights.

  	a.	Incomer per household – To know the average income per household who has purchased a bike, categorized by gender 
   b.	Customer Commute –  To know how commute distance influences bike purchases among customers
   c.	Age brackets - count of customers who purchased a bike based on their age group
  	
6.	For Data visualization, created pivot charts consecutively for three pivot tables - Adding axis titles, Chart title, data tables , to make the bar chart more readable.

  	a.	Bar Chart - Average Income per household – This chart displays the "Average Income Per Purchase" based on gender and whether the person purchased a bike or not. Here's a breakdown of the information:

  	i.	X-Axis: Represents gender (Female and Male).
   ii.	Y-Axis: Represents the average income.

  	b.	Line Chart with markers – Customer Commute - This chart shows the count of customers who purchased a bike based on their commute distance. The x-axis   represents different commute distances, while the y-axis shows the count of bike purchases. The chart helps visualize how commute distance influences bike purchases among customers. ( Adjusted the 10+ miles to More than 10 miles for linear picturization convenience)

  	c.	Line Chart – Customer Age Brackets - This chart shows the count of customers who purchased a bike based on their age group. The x-axis represents different age brackets (Adolescent, Middle Age, and Old), while the y-axis shows the count of bike purchases.
  	
7.	Created a dashboard using the pivot charts to provide a dynamic and efficient way to visualize and summarize the data.
8.	To make dashboards more interactive, Inserted slicers – marital status, Region, Education. Applied the slicers to all three charts in the dashboard

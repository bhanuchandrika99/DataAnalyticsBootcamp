Seattle AirBnB Tableau Project: In this project, we created a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau to analyze Airbnb data from Seattle for the year 2016. The dashboard featured a variety of visualizations, including bar charts, map charts, and line charts, designed to provide detailed insights into the short-term rental market. Key metrics such as price per zip code, revenue trends throughout the year, average price per bedroom, and the distinct count of bedroom listings were highlighted. These visualizations helped to identify patterns and trends, offering a clear picture of the marketâ€™s dynamics and allowing for in-depth analysis of geographical and temporal variations in Airbnb listings and pricing.

The project aimed to build an interactive and user-friendly platform that transformed raw data into actionable insights. We used map charts to visualize the spatial distribution of listings and prices, line charts for revenue tracking, and bar charts for comparing different metrics across locations. Filters and calculated fields were also incorporated to allow users to customize their views based on various criteria such as time frames and property details. This project demonstrated not only technical skills in data visualization and Tableau but also an ability to translate complex datasets into meaningful business insights for better strategic decision-making.

PS: Since the data is too bulky for tableau public, we only used listings and calendar datasets for this project.

DataCleaning using Pandas: 
In this data cleaning project, I focused on preparing a customer call list dataset for analysis by addressing inconsistencies and formatting issues using Python and pandas. The dataset contained several fields, including customer identifiers, names, phone numbers, addresses, payment status, and contact preferences. Initial inspection revealed various inconsistencies, such as different formats in the Phone_Number field, inconsistent Boolean entries for columns like Paying Customer and Do_Not_Contact, and an uninformative column labeled Not_Useful_Column. This assessment helped identify areas requiring standardization and cleaning.

To ensure data uniformity, I standardized the Phone_Number field, converting all entries into a consistent format (e.g., (123) 456-7890), which improves usability and prevents format-based errors. For the Paying Customer and Do_Not_Contact fields, I addressed non-standard responses like "Yes"/"No" and "Y"/"N" by converting them to Boolean values (True or False) for consistency across records. Additionally, I cleaned the Address column to ensure a standardized format, making it easier to parse or analyze location-based data. I also identified entries with missing or invalid data, flagging them for further examination or filling with appropriate placeholders where necessary.

Further, I removed the Not_Useful_Column as it did not add value to the dataset, optimizing the structure and improving readability. After this, I checked for duplicate records to prevent redundant entries and ensured the dataset only retained unique customer data. Any remaining missing values in critical fields were either filled with logical placeholders or, in cases where missing information was excessive, dropped to preserve the quality of the dataset. These cleaning steps have made the dataset well-structured and ready for analysis, allowing for streamlined querying and ensuring reliable data for downstream processes.
